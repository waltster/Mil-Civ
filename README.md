## Directory Structure
* `docs` - Documentation, project papers, etc.
* `src` - Source code, Python Nodebooks, libraries, etc

## Branch Structure
* `main` - Production ready code, tested and tried.
* `test` - Code being tested and needs verified by the team.
* `dev` - In-development code, fine to merge into at any time.

When making changes, create a new branch and then merge it into dev. This will help with concurrent edits and teamwork and prevent losing each others works.
